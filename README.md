# MacroMaestro
MacroMaestro allows you to record your keyboard and mouse inputs and play them back whenever you like.

Currently this is a pretty barebones project allowing recording, playback and saving of macros as well as an autoclicker.
The plan for MacroMaestro is to add more features and become the definitive tool for most tasks related to automating boring manual inputs.

## Installation
Currently the way to run this program would be to clone the repo, install the modules in requirements.txt and run src/main.py
For the future it is planned to provide an MSI installer and a chocolatey package for Windows users as well as a DEB-Package (and possibly packages for other distros) for Linux users
